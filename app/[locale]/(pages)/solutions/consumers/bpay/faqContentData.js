        Arab Financial Services B.S.C.(c) (AFS) owns and operates BPay, which is a secure, easy-to-use, and fully featured digital wallet accessed through an app. BPay is part of a Kingdom-wide initiative to make Bahrain cashless and supports the Kingdom of Bahrain’s government initiatives to drive digital transformation.

        BPay is a digital wallet solution that enables consumers, merchants, and corporations to make and receive their payments in an easy, fast, and secure way via their smartphones instead of cash or card.

        Users can use BPay to purchase goods or services, to send and receive money peer-to-peer (P2P), store money for when they need it, store credentials for various payment instruments securely and digitally, remit money (send money internationally), pay bills, use value-added services and more.

    <p class="text-secondary mt-4 text-sm md:text-base !leading-[150%]">
        The service is available via smartphone applications for consumers, web portals, and directly integrated into AFS Point of Sale (PoS) terminals using APIs for merchants and corporations – for efficient, convenient use. BPay is accessed by smartphone users through a digital app available from any app play store (Google or iOS). Once they have set up the app, users can move funds to their BPay account via Benefit.
