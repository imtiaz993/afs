        Users can use BPay to purchase goods or services, to send and receive money peer-to-peer (P2P), store money for when they need it, store credentials for various payment instruments securely and digitally, remit money (send money internationally), pay bills, use value-added services and more. Customer identity and electronic transactions are secured through eKYC, encryption, tokenization, and various authentication and authorization methods. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-secondary mt-4 text-sm md:text-base !leading-[150%]">
        The service is available via smartphone applications for consumers, web portals, and directly integrated into AFS Point of Sale (PoS) terminals using APIs for merchants and corporations – for efficient, convenient use. BPay is accessed by smartphone users through a digital app available from any app play store (Google or iOS). Once they have set up the app, users can move funds to their BPay account via Benefit.
